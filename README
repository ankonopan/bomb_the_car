## Bomb the car

### A simplistic game for a workshop

I use this game in my workshop about refactoring Ruby code. The game is writen in Gosu. It makes less sense to play it than chewing bubblegum.

### Enhancing the Game

If you would like to enhance the game, remember to do it in the most horrible possible way. Don't expect this game to evolve for the better. The code will get worse and worse, so that the refactoring workshop gets better over time.

All contributions are welcome. If you want to show how bad your code can be... be my guest.

### Initial setup

Install Ruby 1.9.3-p547

Install Gems
> bundle install

Run the game
> ruby game.rb
